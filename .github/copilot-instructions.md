## Project Complete ‚úÖ

This React Native Health Tracker application has been successfully created with:

### ‚úÖ Core Features Implemented:
- **Wear OS Integration**: Heart rate and sleep data sync via Google Fit API
- **Mobile Data Tracking**: Steps counter and screen time monitoring  
- **Supabase Backend**: User authentication and data storage
- **Modern UI**: Clean interface with React Navigation and vector icons
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application

### üèóÔ∏è Project Structure:
- `src/screens/`: HomeScreen, LoginScreen, HistoryScreen
- `src/services/`: Health, Supabase, GoogleFit, ScreenTime services
- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- Navigation setup with React Navigation

### üöÄ Next Steps:
1. **Configure Supabase**: Set up your Supabase project and update credentials in `src/services/supabase.ts`
2. **Google Fit Setup**: Configure Google Cloud Console for Fit API access
3. **Run on Device**: Use `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`
4. **Test Wear OS**: Pair a Wear OS device to test heart rate and sleep data sync

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands:
- `bunx react-native start` - Start Metro Bundler (already running)
- `bunx react-native run-android` - Run on Android device/emulator
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` - TypeScript compilation check

## Project Overview
This is a React Native application that will:
- Connect to Wear OS smartwatches using Google APIs
- Receive heart rate and sleep data from the smartwatch
- Track additional metrics like daily steps and screen time on mobile
- Store all data in Supabase database
- Provide a user interface to view health metrics

## Technologies
- React Native
- Google Fit API / Health Connect API
- Supabase (Backend & Database)
- Wear OS integration
